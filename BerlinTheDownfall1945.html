        "The Red Army had much to avenge when it finally reached the frontiers of the Reich in January 1945. Political
        instructors rammed home the message of Wehrmacht and SS brutality. The result was the most terrifying example of
        fire and sword ever known, with tanks crushing refugee columns under their tracks, mass rape, pillage and
        destruction. Hundreds of thousands of women and children froze to death or were massacred because Nazi Party
        chiefs, refusing to face defeat, had forbidden the evacuation of civilians. Over seven million fled westwards
        from the terror of the Red Army.".

        "Antony Beevor, using often devastating new material from former Soviet files, as well as from German, American,
        British, French and Swedish archives, has reconstructed the experiences of those millions caught up in the
        nightmare of the Third Reich's final collapse. Berlin - The Downfall 1945 is a terrible story of pride,
        stupidity, fanaticism, revenge and savagery, yet it is also one of astonishing endurance, self-sacrifice and
        survival against all odds."--BOOK JACKET.
